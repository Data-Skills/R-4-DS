## Introduction

Every data analysis you conduct will likely involve manipulating dataframes at some point. Quickly extracting, 
transforming, and summarizing information from dataframes is an essential R skill. In this part we'll use Hadley 
Wickham’s dplyr package, which consolidates and simplifies many of the common operations we perform on dataframes. 
In addition, much of dplyr key functionality is written in C++ for speed.

```{r setup, message = TRUE}
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


> ## Important!

> Take careful note of the conflicts message that's printed when you load the tidyverse. It tells you that dplyr overwrites some 
> functions in base R. If you want to use the base version of these functions after loading dplyr, you'll need to use their full 
> names: `stats::filter()` and `stats::lag()`.

## Dataset

We will use the dataset Dataset_S1.txt from the paper "[The Influence of Recombination on Human Genetic Diversity](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020148)", 
which contains estimates of population genetics statistics such 
as nucleotide diversity (e.g., the columns Pi and Theta), recombination (column Recombination), and sequence 
divergence as estimated by percent identity between human and chimpanzee genomes (column Divergence). 
Other columns contain information about the sequencing depth (depth), and GC content 
(percent.GC) for 1kb windows in human chromosome 20. We’ll only work with a few columns in our examples; 
see the description of Dataset_S1.txt in the original paper for more detail.


> ## Miscellaneous Tips
>
> * Files can be downloaded directly from the Internet into a local folder of your choice using the `download.file` function.
> The `read_csv` function can then be executed to read the downloaded file from the download location, for example,
> ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
> download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/Dataset_S1.txt", destfile = "data/Dataset_S1.txt")
> dvst <- read_csv("data/Dataset_S1.txt")
> ```
>
> * Alternatively, you can read files directly from the Internet into R by replacing the file paths with a web address in `read_csv`. In doing this no local copy of the csv file is first saved onto your computer. For example,
> ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
> dvst <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/Dataset_S1.txt")
> ```
{: .callout}

So, let's read the file directly into a `tbl_df` or `tibble`:

```{r}
dvst <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/Dataset_S1.txt")
```

Notice the parsing of columns in the file. Also notice that some of the columns names 
contain spaces and special characters. We'll replace them soon to facilitate typing.
Type `dvst` to look at the dataframe:

```{r}
dvst
```

Because it’s common to work with dataframes with more rows and columns than fit in your screen, `tibble` 
wraps dataframes so that they don’t fill your screen when you print them 
(similar to using `head()`). Notice that the tibble only shows the first few rows and all the columns that 
fit on one screen. Run `View(dvst)`, which will open the dataset in the RStudio viewer, to see the whole dataframe. 
Also notice the row of three (or four) letter abbreviations under the column names. 
These describe the type of each variable:

* `int` stands for integers.

* `dbl` stands for doubles, or real numbers.

* `fctr` stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables
  with fixed possible values.
  
There are four other common types of variables that aren't used in this dataset:

* `chr` stands for character vectors, or strings.

* `dttm` stands for date-times (a date + a time).

* `lgl` stands for logical, vectors that contain only `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

* `date` stands for dates.

Although the standard R operations work with tibbles (see below), we'll learn how to use dplyr functions insted

```{r}
colnames(dvst)[12] <- "percent.GC" #rename X.GC columns
dvst$GC.binned <- cut(dvst$percent.GC, 5) # create a new column from existing data
```

## `dplyr` basics

There are five key dplyr functions that allow you to solve the vast majority of data manipulation challenges:

* Pick observations by their values (`filter()`).
* Reorder the rows (`arrange()`).
* Pick variables by their names (`select()`).
* Create new variables with functions of existing variables (`mutate()`).
* Collapse many values down to a single summary (`summarise()`).

None of these functions perform tasks you can’t accomplish with R’s base functions. 
But dplyr’s advantage is in the added consistency, speed, and versatility of its data manipulation interface. 

dplyr functions be used in conjunction with `group_by()` which changes the scope of each function from operating 
on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the verbs for a language of 
data manipulation.

All verbs work similarly: 

1.  The first argument is a data frame.

1.  The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame,
    using the variable names (without quotes).
    
1.  The result is a new data frame.

Together these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result. 
Let's dive in and see how these verbs work.

===

## Use `filter()` to filter rows

Let's say we used `summary` to get an idea about the total number of SNPs in different windows:

```{r}
summary(dvst$`total SNPs`)
# or with dplyr
select(dvst,`total SNPs`) %>% summary()
```

We see that this varies quite considerably across all windows on chromosome 20 and the data are right-skewed: 
the third quartile is 12 SNPs, but the maximum is 93 SNPs. Often we want to investigate such outliers more 
closely. We can use `filter()` to extract the rows of our dataframe based on their values. The first argument 
is the name of the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame.

```{r}
filter(dvst,`total SNPs` >= 85)
```

We can build more elaborate queries by using multiple filters. For example, suppose we wanted to see all windows 
where Pi (nucleotide diversity) is greater than 16 and percent GC is greater than 80. We’d use:

```{r}
filter(dvst, Pi > 16, percent.GC > 80)
```

When you run that line of code, dplyr executes the filtering operation and returns a new data frame. 
Note, **dplyr functions never modify their inputs**, so if you want to save the result, you'll need to use the 
assignment operator, `<-`:

```{r}
new_df <- filter(dvst, Pi > 16, percent.GC > 80)
```

> ## Miscellaneous Tips
>
> R either prints out the results, or saves them to a variable. If you want to do both, you can wrap the 
assignment in parentheses:
> 
> ```{r}
> (search_db <- filter(dvst, Pi > 16, percent.GC > 80))
> ```
{: .callout}

### Comparisons

To use filtering effectively, you have to know how to select the observations that you want using the 
comparison operators. R provides the standard suite: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). 

> ## Common pitfalls
>
> When you're starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use `=` instead of `==` when testing for equality. When this > happens you'll get an informative error:
> 
> ```{r, error = TRUE}
> filter(dvst, `total SNPs` = 0)
> ```
>
> There's another common problem you might encounter when using `==`: floating point numbers. 
> These results might surprise you!
> 
> ```{r}
> sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
> 1/49 * 49 == 1
> ```
> 
> Computers use finite precision arithmetic (they obviously can't store an infinite number of digits!) 
> so remember that every number you see is an approximation. Instead of relying on `==`, use `near()`:
> 
> ```{r}
> near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)
> near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
> ```
>
{: .callout}

### Logical operators

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with "and": every expression must be true in order for a 
row to be included in the output. For other types of combinations, you'll need to use Boolean operators 
yourself: `&` is "and", `|` is "or", and `!` is "not". Figure \@ref(fig:bool-ops) shows the complete set 
of Boolean operations.

```{r bool-ops, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Complete set of boolean operations. `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each operator selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/transform-logical.png")
```

If you are looking for multiple values within a certain column, use the `x %in% y` shortcut. This will 
select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(dvst, total.SNPs %in% c(0,2))
```

Notice, how the following search gives some unexpected results:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(dvst, total.SNPs == 0 | 2)
```

Finally, whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit 
variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. We'll learn how to create new variables shortly.


### Missing values

One important feature of R that can make comparison tricky are missing values, or `NA`s ("not availables"). 
`NA` represents an unknown value so missing values are "contagious": almost any operation involving an unknown 
value will also be unknown.

```{r}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
NA == NA
```

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want 
to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r}
filter(dvst, is.na(Divergence))
## compare to
dvst %>% add_row() %>% filter(is.na(Divergence))
```

### Exercises

1.  Find all windows

    1. With the lowest/highest GC content
    1. That have 0 total SNPs
    1. That are incomplete (<1000 bp)
    1. That have the highest divergence with the chimp
    1. That have less than 5% GC difference from the mean

1.  Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do?
    Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous 
    challenges?

## Use `mutate() to add new variables`

It's often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns (notice, how we used `dvst$GC.binned <- cut(dvst$percent.GC, 5)` above). That's the job of `mutate()`. 

`mutate()` always adds new columns at the end of your dataset. Remember that when you're in RStudio, the easiest 
way to see all the columns is `View()`.

Here we'll add an additional column that indicates whether a window is in the centromere region. The positions 
of the chromosome 20 centromere (based on Giemsa banding) are 25,800,000 to 29,700,000 (see this chapter’s README 
on GitHub to see how these coordinates were found). To append a column called cent that has TRUE/FALSE values 
indicating whether the current window is fully within a centromeric region we'll use comparison and logical operations:

```{r}
mutate(dvst, cent = start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000)
dvst
```

{: .challenge}

In the dataset we are using, the diversity estimate Pi is measured per sampling window (1kb) and scaled 
up by 10x (see supplementary Text S1 for more details). It would be useful to have this scaled as per 
basepair nucleotide diversity (so as to make the scale more intuitive).

```{r}
mutate(dvst, diversity = Pi / (10*1000)) # rescale, removing 10x and making per bp
```

Notice, that we can combine the two operations in a single command (and also save the result):

```{r}
dvst <- mutate(dvst, 
       diversity = Pi / (10*1000), 
       cent = start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000
)
```

If you only want to keep the new variables, use `transmute()`:

```{r}
transmute(dvst,
  diversity = Pi / (10*1000), 
  cent = start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000
)
```

## Use `arrange()` to arrange rows

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of selecting rows, it changes their order. 
It takes a data frame and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you 
provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of 
preceding columns:

```{r}
arrange(dvst, cent, percent.GC)
```

Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(dvst, desc(cent), percent.GC)
```

Note, that missing values are always sorted at the end!

### Exercises

1.  How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start?
    (Hint: use `is.na()`).

===    

## Use `select()` to select columns and `rename()` to rename them

It's not uncommon to get datasets with hundreds or even thousands of variables. In this case, the first 
challenge is often narrowing in on the variables you're actually interested in. `select()` allows you to 
rapidly zoom in on a useful subset using operations based on the names of the variables.

`select()` is not terribly useful with our data because they only have a few variables, but you can still 
get the general idea:

```{r}
# Select columns by name
select(dvst, start, end, Divergence)
# Select all columns between year and day (inclusive)
select(dvst, depth:Pi)
# Select all columns except those from year to day (inclusive)
select(dvst, -(start:percent.GC))
```

There are a number of helper functions you can use within `select()`:

* `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with "abc".

* `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with "xyz".

* `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain "ijk".

* `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression.
   This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters. You'll 
   learn more about regular expressions in [strings].
   
*  `num_range("x", 1:3)` matches `x1`, `x2` and `x3`.
   
See `?select` for more details.

`select()` can also be used to rename variables, but it's rarely useful because it drops all of the variables 
not explicitly mentioned. Instead, use `rename()`, which is a variant of `select()` that keeps all the 
variables that aren't explicitly mentioned:

```{r}
dvst <- rename(dvst, total.SNPs = `total SNPs`,
       total.Bases = `total Bases`,
       unique.SNPs = `unique SNPs`,
       reference.Bases = `reference Bases`) #renaming all the columns with spaces!
colnames(dvst)
```

Another option is to use `select()` in conjunction with the `everything()` helper. This is useful if you 
have a handful of variables you'd like to move to the start of the data frame.

```{r}
select(dvst, cent, everything())
```

===

## Use `summarise()` to make summaries

The last key verb is `summarise()`. It collapses a data frame to a single row:

```{r}
summarise(dvst, GC = mean(percent.GC, na.rm = TRUE), averageSNPs=mean(total.SNPs, na.rm = TRUE), allSNPs=sum(total.SNPs))
```

`summarise()` is not terribly useful unless we pair it with `group_by()`. This changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. Then, when you use the dplyr verbs on a grouped data frame they'll be automatically applied "by group". For example, if we applied exactly the same code to a data frame grouped by position related to centromere:

```{r}
by_cent <- group_by(dvst, cent)
summarise(by_cent, GC = mean(percent.GC, na.rm = TRUE), averageSNPs=mean(total.SNPs, na.rm = TRUE), allSNPs=sum(total.SNPs))
```

Subsetting columns can be a useful way to summarize data across two different conditions. 
For example, we might be curious if the average depth in a window (the depth column) 
differs between very high GC content windows (greater than 80%) and all other windows:

```{r}
by_GC <- group_by(dvst, percent.GC >= 80)
summarize(by_GC, depth=mean(depth))
```

This is a fairly large difference, but it’s important to consider how many windows this includes. 
Whenever you do any aggregation, it's always a good idea to include either a count (`n()`), 
or a count of non-missing values (`sum(!is.na(x))`). That way you can check that you're not 
drawing conclusions based on very small amounts of data:

```{r}
summarize(by_GC, mean_depth=mean(depth), n_rows=n())
```

> *   Measures of location: we've used `mean(x)`, but `median(x)` is also useful.

Together `group_by()` and `summarise()` provide one of the tools that you'll use most commonly when working with dplyr: grouped summaries. But before we go any further with this, we need to introduce a powerful new idea: the pipe.

### Combining multiple operations with the pipe

It looks like we have been creating and naming several intermediate files in our anlysis, even though we didn't care about them. Naming things is hard, so this slows down our analysis. 

There's another way to tackle the same problem with the pipe, `%>%`:

```{r}
dvst %>%
  rename(GC.percent = percent.GC) %>%
  group_by(GC.percent >= 80) %>%
  summarize(mean_depth=mean(depth, na.rm = TRUE), n_rows=n())
```

This focuses on the transformations, not what's being transformed. 
You can read it as a series of imperative statements: group, then summarise, then filter, 
where `%>%` stands for "then".

Behind the scenes, `x %>% f(y)` turns into `f(x, y)`, and `x %>% f(y) %>% g(z)` turns into 
`g(f(x, y), z)` and so on.

Working with the pipe is one of the key criteria for belonging to the tidyverse. The only exception is 
ggplot2: it was written before the pipe was discovered. However, the next iteration of ggplot2, 
ggvis, will use the pipe. 

> ## RStudio Tip
> A shortcut for %>% is available in the newest RStudio releases under the keybinding 
> CTRL + SHIFT + M (or CMD + SHIFT + M for OSX).  
> You can also review the set of available keybindings when within RStudio with ALT + SHIFT + K.

### Grouping by multiple variables

When you group by multiple variables, each summary peels off one level of the grouping. That makes it easy to progressively roll up a dataset:

```{r}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
(per_day   <- summarise(daily, flights = n()))
(per_month <- summarise(per_day, flights = sum(flights)))
(per_year  <- summarise(per_month, flights = sum(flights)))
```

Be careful when progressively rolling up summaries: it's OK for sums and counts, but you need to think about weighting means and variances, and it's not possible to do it exactly for rank-based statistics like the median. In other words, the sum of groupwise sums is the overall sum, but the median of groupwise medians is not the overall median.

### Ungrouping

If you need to remove grouping, and return to operations on ungrouped data, use `ungroup()`. 

```{r}
daily %>% 
  ungroup() %>%             # no longer grouped by date
  summarise(flights = n())  # all flights
```

### Exercises

1.  What does the `sort` argument to `count()` do. When might you use it?

## Grouped mutates (and filters)

Grouping is most useful in conjunction with `summarise()`, but you can also do convenient operations with `mutate()` and `filter()`:

*   Find the worst members of each group:

    ```{r}
    flights_sml %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>%
      filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 10)
    ```

*   Find all groups bigger than a threshold:

    ```{r}
    popular_dests <- flights %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      filter(n() > 365)
    popular_dests
    ```

*   Standardise to compute per group metrics:

    ```{r}
    popular_dests %>% 
      filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
      mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay / sum(arr_delay)) %>% 
      select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay)
    ```

A grouped filter is a grouped mutate followed by an ungrouped filter. I generally avoid them except for quick and dirty manipulations: otherwise it's hard to check that you've done the manipulation correctly.

Functions that work most naturally in grouped mutates and filters are known as  window functions (vs. the summary functions used for summaries). You can learn more about useful window functions in the corresponding vignette: `vignette("window-functions")`.

### Exercises

1.  Refer back to the lists of useful mutate and filtering functions. 
    Describe how each operation changes when you combine it with grouping.

#### Grouped operations

dplyr’s raw power comes from the way it handles grouping and summarizing data. For these examples, 
let’s use the mtfs dataframe, as it has some nice factor columns we can group by. If you need to reload it, use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtfs <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/motif_recombrates.txt", header=TRUE)
```

Begin by converting it to a `tbl_df` object:

```{r}
mtfs_df <- tbl_df(mtfs)
```

Now let’s group by the chromosome column chr. We can group by one or more columns by calling `group_by()` 
with their names as arguments:

```{r}
mtfs_df %>% group_by(chr)
```

Note that dplyr’s output now includes a line indicating which column(s) the dataset is grouped by. Now dplyr’s 
functions will be applied per group rather than on all data (where applicable). The most common use case is 
to create summaries as we did with `tapply()` and `aggregate()` using the `summarize()` function:

```{r}
mtfs_df %>% 
        group_by(chr) %>%
        summarize(max_recom = max(recom), mean_recom = mean(recom), num=n())
```

dplyr’s `summarize()` handles passing the relevant column to each function and automatically creates columns 
with the supplied argument names. Because we’ve grouped this data by chromosome, `summarize()` computes 
per-group summaries. Try this same expression without `group_by()`.

We can chain additional operations on these grouped and summarized results; for example, if we wanted to sort 
by the newly created summary column max_recom:

```{r}
mtfs_df %>% group_by(chr) %>%
         summarize(max_recom = max(recom), mean_recom = mean(recom), num=n()) %>%
         arrange(desc(max_recom))
```

dplyr has a few other functions such as `distinct()` (which returns only unique values), and sampling functions 
like `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()` (which sample observations). Finally, one of the best features of dplyr is 
that all of these same methods also work with database connections. For example, you can manipulate a SQLite 
database with all of the same verbs we’ve used here.
