# Data visualization

## Introduction

> "The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind 
> than any other device." --- John Tukey

In this lesson we will learn how to visualise your data using ggplot2. R has several systems for making graphs, but ggplot2 is one of the most elegant and most versatile. ggplot2 implements the [__grammar of graphics__](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf), a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.

The lesson is based on Chapter 2 of the [R for Data Science](R for Data Science) book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

### Prerequisites

ggplot2 is one of the core members of the tidyverse. Load the tidyverse by running this code:

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you run this code and get the error message "there is no package called ‘tidyverse’", you'll need to first install it, then run `library()` once again.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

> ## Tip
> You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session. 
> You can also use `require()` function to check whether ggplot2 is already installed:
> ```{r}
> if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
> library(ggplot2)
> ```
{: .callout}

## Dataset

We will use the same dataset Dataset_S1.txt from the paper "[The Influence of Recombination on Human Genetic Diversity](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020148)" as 
in the previous dataset.  As a reminder, it contains estimates of population genetics statistics such 
as nucleotide diversity (e.g., the columns Pi and Theta), recombination (column Recombination), and sequence divergence as estimated by percent identity between human and chimpanzee genomes (column Divergence). Other columns contain information about the sequencing depth (depth), and GC content 
(percent.GC) for 1kb windows in human chromosome 20.

Let's read it as a tibble and modify as we did before:

```{r}
dvst <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/master/chapter-08-r/Dataset_S1.txt")
```

> ## Tip
>
> Note, that we are reading the file with dplyr function `read_csv` rather than 
> the base function `read.cvs`!
{: .callout}

```{r}
(dvst <- dvst %>% 
  mutate(diversity = Pi / (10*1000), cent = (start >= 25800000 & end <= 29700000)) %>% 
  rename(percent.GC = `%GC`))
```

## Exploring Data Visually with ggplot2 I: Scatterplots and Densities

We'll start by using ggplot2 to create a scatterplot of nucleotide diversity along the chromosome. 
But because our data is window-based, we’ll first add a column called position that’s 
the midpoint between each window:

```{r}
dvst <- mutate(dvst, position = (end + start) / 2)
```

Now we make a ggplot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=position, y=diversity))
```

> ## Note
> With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function `ggplot()`. `ggplot()` creates a 
> coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of `ggplot()` is 
> the dataset to use in the graph. So `ggplot(data = dvrs)` creates an empty graph.
>
> You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to `ggplot()`. 
> `geom_point()`is a type of geometric object (or geom in ggplot2 lingo) that creates 
> a scatterplot. Note, that to add a layer, we use the same `+` 
> operator that we use for addition in R.
> 
> Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument. This defines how variables 
> in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The `mapping` argument is always 
> paired with `aes()`, and the `x` and `y` arguments of `aes()` specify which variables 
> to map to the x and y axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variable in the `data` 
> argument, in this case, `dvrs`.
{: .callout}

### A graphing template

Let's turn this code into a reusable template for making graphs with ggplot2. To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

ggplot2 has many geoms (e.g., `geom_line()`, `geom_bar()`, etc). 
> RStudio provides a useful [cheat sheet][cheat], which, among other things, shows 
> different geometric objects. 

### Aesthetic mappings

> "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
> never expected to see." --- John Tukey

Notice the missing diversity estimates in the middle of this plot. What’s going on in this region? 
ggplot2’s strength is that it makes answering these types of questions with exploratory data analysis 
techniques effortless. We simply need to map a possible confounder or explanatory variable to another 
aesthetic and see if this reveals any unexpected patterns. In this case, let’s map the color aesthetic 
of our point geometric objects to the column cent, which indicates whether the window falls in the 
centromeric region of this chromosome

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=position, y=diversity, color=cent))
```

In the above example, we mapped `cent` to the color aesthetic, but we could have mapped it to other
aesthetic in the same way. Here are examples of mapping `cent` to the _alpha_ aesthetic, which controls 
the transparency of the points, or the shape of the points.

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'default', warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 1/2, fig.cap =""}
# Left
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = position, y = diversity, alpha = cent))

# Right
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = position, y = diversity, shape = cent))
```

This did not work so well, but you should get an idea!

> ## Note
> Geometric objects have many aesthetic attributes (e.g., color, shape, size, etc.). 
> The beauty of ggplot2s grammar is that it allows you to map geometric objects’ 
> aesthetics to columns in your dataframe. The `aes()` function gathers together each 
> of the aesthetic mappings used by a layer and passes them to the layer's mapping argument. 
> The syntax highlights a useful insight about `x` and `y`: the x and y locations of a point 
> are themselves aesthetics, visual properties that you can map to variables to display 
> information about the data. 
> Once you map an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale 
> to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a legend that explains the mapping between 
> levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, ggplot2 does not create a legend, but it 
> creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line acts as a legend: it 
> explains the mapping between locations and values.
{: .callout}

You can also _set_ the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example, we can make 
all of the points in our plot blue:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = position, y = diversity), color = "blue")
```

Here, the color doesn't convey information about a variable, but only changes the 
appearance of the plot. To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name 
as an argument of your geom function; i.e. it goes _outside_ of `aes()`. You'll 
need to pick a value that makes sense for that aesthetic:

* The name of a color as a character string.
* The size of a point in mm.
* The shape of a point as a number, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:shapes).

```{r shapes, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.asp = 1/3, fig.cap="R has 25 built in shapes that are identified by numbers. There are some seeming duplicates: for example, 0, 15, and 22 are all squares. The difference comes from the interaction of the `colour` and `fill` aesthetics. The hollow shapes (0--14) have a border determined by `colour`; the solid shapes (15--18) are filled with `colour`; the filled shapes (21--24) have a border of `colour` and are filled with `fill`.", warning = FALSE}
shapes <- tibble(
  shape = c(0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6:19, 22, 21, 24, 23, 20),
  x = (0:24 %/% 5) / 2,
  y = (-(0:24 %% 5)) / 4
)
ggplot(shapes, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15) +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  expand_limits(x = 4.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL, limits = c(-1.2, 0.2)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/2.75)
```

Finally, note, that aesthetic mappings can also be specified in the call to ggplot(); 
different geoms will then use this mapping:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = dvst, mapping = (aes(x=position, y=diversity)) + geom_point()
```

### Exercises

1.  What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```
    
1.  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
    (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How
    can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

1.  Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape`. How do
    these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous
    variables? 
    
1.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 

1.  What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
    (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
    
1.  What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable 
    name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?

{: .callout}

### Overplotting
One problem with our plots (and scatterplots in general) is overplotting (some data points obscure 
the information of other data points). We can’t get a sense of the distribution of diversity from this 
figure everything is saturated from about 0.05 and below. One way to alleviate overplotting is to make 
points somewhat transparent (the transparency level is known as the alpha):

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=position, y=diversity), alpha=0.01)
```
Note that we set alpha=0.01 outside of the aesthetic mapping function aes() as we did with the color in
the previous example. This is because we’re not mapping the alpha aesthetic to a column of data in our dataframe, but rather giving it a fixed value for all data points.

Let’s now look at the density of diversity across all positions. We’ll use a different geometric object, 
`geom_density()`, which is slightly different than `geom_point()` in that it takes the data and calculates 
a density from it for us:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=diversity), fill="blue")
```

We can also map the color aesthetic of `geom_density()` to a discrete-valued column in our dataframe, 
just as we did with `geom_point()`. `geom_density()` will create separate density plots, grouping data 
by the column mapped to the color aesthetic and using colors to indicate the different densities. 
To see both overlapping densities, we use alpha to set the transparency to 0.4:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=diversity, fill=cent), alpha=0.4)
```

Immediately we’re able to see a trend that wasn’t clear by using a scatterplot: diversity is 
skewed to more extreme values in centromeric regions. Again (because this point is worth repeating), 
mapping columns to additional aesthetic attributes can reveal patterns and information in the data 
that may not be apparent in simple plots. 

## Exploring Data Visually with ggplot2 II: Smoothing
Let’s look at the Dataset_S1.txt data using another useful ggplot2 feature: smoothing. 
We’ll use ggplot2 in particular to investigate potential confounders in genomic data. 
There are numerous potential confounders in genomic data (e.g., sequencing read depth; 
GC content; mapability, or whether a region is capable of having reads correctly align 
to it; batch effects; etc.). Often with large and high-dimension datasets, visualization 
is the easiest and best way to spot these potential issues.

Earlier, we used transparency to give us a sense of the most dense regions. Another 
strategy is to use ggplot2’s `geom_smooth()` to add a smoothing line to plots and look 
for an unexpected trend. Let’s use a scatterplot and smoothing curve to look at the 
relationship between the sequencing depth (the depth column) and the total number of 
SNPs in a window (the total.SNPs column):

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst, mapping = aes(x=depth, y=`total SNPs`)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) + geom_smooth()
```

Notice that because both `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` use the same x and y mapping, we can specify 
the aesthetic in `ggplot()` function.

## Binning Data with `cut(`) and Bar Plots with ggplot2

Next, let's take a look at a bar chart. Bar charts seem simple, but they reveal something subtle about plots. 
Consider a basic bar chart, as drawn with `geom_bar()`. As you can see, there are ~60000 windows in the dataset, 
most of them outside the centromeric region. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cent))
```

On the x-axis, the chart displays `cent`, a variable from `dvst`. On the y-axis, it displays count,
but count is not a variable in `dvst`! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, 
plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:

* bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data 
  and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

* smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the
  model.

* boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a 
  specially formatted box.

The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a __stat__, short for statistical transformation. 
The figure below describes how this process works with `geom_bar()`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-stat-bar.png")
```

You can learn which stat a geom uses by inspecting the default value for the `stat` argument. 
For example, `?geom_bar` shows that the default value for `stat` is "count", which means that 
`geom_bar()` uses `stat_count()`. `stat_count()` is documented on the same page as `geom_bar()`, 
and if you scroll down you can find a section called "Computed variables". That describes how 
it computes two new variables: `count` and `prop`.

You can generally use geoms and stats interchangeably. For example, you can recreate the previous 
plot using `stat_count()` instead of `geom_bar()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cent))
```

This works because every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom. This means 
that you can typically use geoms without worrying about the underlying statistical transformation. 
There are three reasons you might need to use a stat explicitly:

1.  You might want to override the default stat. For example, the height of the bar may be already
    present in the data as another variable, in which case you will use `stat = "identity"`

1.  You might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables
    to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of
    proportion, rather than count:
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = dvst) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cent, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
    ```

1.  You might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation
    in your code. For example, you might use `stat_summary()`, which
    summarises the y values for each unique x value, to draw 
    attention to the summary that you're computing:
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = dvst) + 
      stat_summary(
        mapping = aes(x = cent, y = percent.GC),
        fun.ymin = min,
        fun.ymax = max,
        fun.y = median
      )
    ```
    
ggplot2 provides over 20 stats for you to use. Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g. `?stat_bin`. To see a complete list of stats, check the [ggplot2 cheatsheet]().

So far we used cent, the only discrete variable in our dataset.  Let's create another one by
splitting the percent.GC into 5 categories:

```{r}
dvst <- dvst %>% 
  mutate(GC.binned = cut(percent.GC, 5));
select(dvst, GC.binned)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=GC.binned))
```

The bins created from `cut()` are useful in grouping data (a concept we often use in data analysis). 
For example, we can use the GC.binned column to group data by %GC content bins to see how GC content 
has an impact on other variables. To do this, we map aesthetics like color, fill, or linetype to our GC.binned column:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_density(mapping = aes(x=depth, linetype=GC.binned), alpha=0.5)
```

What happens if we geom_bar()’s x aesthetic is mapped to a continuous column (e.g., percent.GC)? 
geom_bar() will automatically bin the data itself, creating a histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dvst) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=percent.GC))
```

But it does not look like the plot we had!  Hence, the challenge:

> Using scale_x_continuous() just ignores all windows with 0 Pi and zooms into the figure.

### Exercises

1.  What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could
    you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the 
    stat function?

1.  What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

1.  Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in 
    concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the 
    pairs. What do they have in common?

1.  What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control
    its behaviour?

1.  In our proportion bar chart, we need to set `group = 1`. Why? In other
    words what is the problem with these two graphs?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
    ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
    ```
  

## Position adjustments

There's one more piece of magic associated with bar charts. You can color a bar chart using 
either the `colour` aesthetic, or, more usefully, `fill`:

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = cut))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))
```

Note what happens if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like `clarity`: the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of `cut` and `clarity`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

The stacking is performed automatically by the __position adjustment__ specified by the `position` argument. If you don't want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: `"identity"`, `"dodge"` or `"fill"`.

*   `position = "identity"` will place each object exactly where it falls in 
    the context of the graph. This is not very useful for bars, because it
    overlaps them. To see that overlapping we either need to make the bars
    slightly transparent by setting `alpha` to a small value, or completely
    transparent by setting `fill = NA`.
    
    ```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default"}
    ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + 
      geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, position = "identity")
    ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = clarity)) + 
      geom_bar(fill = NA, position = "identity")
    ```
    
    The identity position adjustment is more useful for 2d geoms, like points,
    where it is the default.
    
*   `position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars
    the same height. This makes it easier to compare proportions across 
    groups.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
    ```

*   `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly _beside_ one 
    another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
    ```

There's one other type of adjustment that's not useful for bar charts, but it can be very useful for scatterplots. Recall our first scatterplot. Did you notice that the plot displays only 126 points, even though there are 234 observations in the dataset?

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

The values of `hwy` and `displ` are rounded so the points appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. This problem is known as __overplotting__. This arrangement makes it hard to see where the mass of the data is. Are the data points spread equally throughout the graph, or is there one special combination of `hwy` and `displ` that contains 109 values? 

You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to "jitter".  `position = "jitter"` adds a small amount of random noise to each point. This spreads the points out because no two points are likely to receive the same amount of random noise.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")
```

Adding randomness seems like a strange way to improve your plot, but while it makes your graph less accurate at small scales, it makes your graph _more_ revealing at large scales. Because this is such a useful operation, ggplot2 comes with a shorthand for `geom_point(position = "jitter")`: `geom_jitter()`.

To learn more about a position adjustment, look up the help page associated with each adjustment: `?position_dodge`, `?position_fill`, `?position_identity`, `?position_jitter`, and `?position_stack`.

### Exercises

1.  What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

1.  What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

1.  Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

1.  What's the default position adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create
    a visualisation of the `mpg` dataset that demonstrates it.

## Facets

One way to add additional variables is with aesthetics. Another way, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into __facets__, subplots that each display one subset of the data. 

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. The first argument of `facet_wrap()` should be a formula, which you create with `~` followed by a variable name (here "formula" is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for "equation"). The variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be discrete. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add `facet_grid()` to your plot call. The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a `~`. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

If you prefer to not facet in the rows or columns dimension, use a `.` instead of a variable name, e.g. `+ facet_grid(. ~ cyl)`.

### Exercises

1.  What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

1.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

1.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

1.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
1.  Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other
    options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't
    `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` argument?

1.  When using `facet_grid()` you should usually put the variable with more
    unique levels in the columns. Why?

## Geometric objects

How are these two plots similar? 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align="default", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Both plots contain the same x variable, the same y variable, and both describe the same data. But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different visual object to represent the data. In ggplot2 syntax, we say that they use different __geoms__.

A __geom__ is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom. As we see above, you can use different geoms to plot the same data. The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses the smooth geom, a smooth line fitted to the data. 

To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to `ggplot()`. For instance, to make the plots above, you can use this code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# left
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# right
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn't set the "shape" of a line. On the other hand, you _could_ set the linetype of a line. `geom_smooth()` will draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value of the variable that you map to linetype.

```{r message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```

Here `geom_smooth()` separates the cars into three lines based on their `drv` value, which describes a car's drivetrain. One line describes all of the points with a `4` value, one line describes all of the points with an `f` value, and one line describes all of the points with an `r` value. Here, `4` stands for four-wheel drive, `f` for front-wheel drive, and `r` for rear-wheel drive.

If this sounds strange, we can make it more clear by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to `drv`. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv))
```

Notice that this plot contains two geoms in the same graph! If this makes you excited, buckle up. In the next section, we will learn how to place multiple geoms in the same plot.

ggplot2 provides over 30 geoms, and extension packages provide even more (see <https://www.ggplot2-exts.org> for a sampling). The best way to get a comprehensive overview is the ggplot2 cheatsheet, which you can find at <http://rstudio.com/cheatsheets>. To learn more about any single geom, use help: `?geom_smooth`.

Many geoms, like `geom_smooth()`, use a single geometric object to display multiple rows of data. For these geoms, you can set the `group` aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the `linetype` example). It is convenient to rely on this feature because the group aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms.

```{r, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'default', out.width = "33%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
              
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
    
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
```

To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom functions to `ggplot()`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

This, however, introduces some duplication in our code. Imagine if you wanted to change the y-axis to display `cty` instead of `hwy`. You'd need to change the variable in two places, and you might forget to update one. You can avoid this type of repetition by passing a set of mappings to `ggplot()`. ggplot2 will treat these mappings as global mappings that apply to each geom in the graph.  In other words, this code will produce the same plot as the previous code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings _for that layer only_. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

You can use the same idea to specify different `data` for each layer. Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the `mpg` dataset, the subcompact cars. The local data argument in `geom_smooth()` overrides the global data argument in `ggplot()` for that layer only.

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```

(You'll learn how `filter()` works in the next chapter: for now, just know that this command selects only the subcompact cars.)

    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point(size = 4, colour = "white") + 
      geom_point(aes(colour = drv))
    ```


## Coordinate systems

Coordinate systems are probably the most complicated part of ggplot2. The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the x and y positions act independently to determine the location of each point. There are a number of other coordinate systems that are occasionally helpful.

*   `coord_flip()` switches the x and y axes. This is useful (for example),
    if you want horizontal boxplots. It's also useful for long labels: it's
    hard to get them to fit without overlapping on the x-axis.
    
    ```{r fig.width = 3, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default"}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_boxplot()
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_boxplot() +
      coord_flip()
    ```

*   `coord_quickmap()` sets the aspect ratio correctly for maps. This is very
    important if you're plotting spatial data with ggplot2 (which unfortunately
    we don't have the space to cover in this book).

    ```{r fig.width = 3, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", message = FALSE}
    nz <- map_data("nz")

    ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
      geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black")

    ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
      geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black") +
      coord_quickmap()
    ```

*   `coord_polar()` uses polar coordinates. Polar coordinates reveal an 
    interesting connection between a bar chart and a Coxcomb chart.
    
    ```{r fig.width = 3, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", fig.asp = 1}
    bar <- ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(
        mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut), 
        show.legend = FALSE,
        width = 1
      ) + 
      theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
      labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
    
    bar + coord_flip()
    bar + coord_polar()
    ```

    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline() +
      coord_fixed()
    ```

## The layered grammar of graphics

In the previous sections, you learned much more than how to make scatterplots, bar charts, and boxplots. You learned a foundation that you can use to make _any_ type of plot with ggplot2. To see this, let's add position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting to our code template:

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

Our new template takes seven parameters, the bracketed words that appear in the template. In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven parameters to make a graph because ggplot2 will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the mappings, and the geom function.

The seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a formal system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe _any_ plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, and a faceting scheme. 

To see how this works, consider how you could build a basic plot from scratch: you could start with a dataset and then transform it into the information that you want to display (with a stat).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-grammar-1.png")
```

Next, you could choose a geometric object to represent each observation in the transformed data. You could then use the aesthetic properties of the geoms to represent variables in the data. You would map the values of each variable to the levels of an aesthetic.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-grammar-2.png")
```

You'd then select a coordinate system to place the geoms into. You'd use the location of the objects (which is itself an aesthetic property) to display the values of the x and y variables. At that point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the geoms within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting). You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-grammar-3.png")
```

You could use this method to build _any_ plot that you imagine. In other words, you can use the code template that you've learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots.
